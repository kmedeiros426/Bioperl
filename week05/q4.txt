Table mRNA: mrna ID (int), gene ID (int), tissue (varchar), expression level (int), orf start (int), orf stop (int)
Table Gene: gene ID (int), gene name (varchar), organism ID (int), sequence (text)
Table Organism: organism ID (int), organism name (varchar), tissue ID (int)

Reasoning: Each mRNA is expressed from a single gene but it's attributes can be dependent on tissue type. So, mRNA is a unique entity with unique attributes.
The genes themselves always have the same sequence regardless of what tissue they are in and the organism can have many tissue types. 
Each attribute is only in one table and data is linked by using the unique identifiers from other tables.
